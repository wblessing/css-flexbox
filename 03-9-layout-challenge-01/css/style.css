   1. At a viewport width of 32.5em
      and bigger, .subscribe and 
      .recent-episodes should go next to 
      one another

  2.  They should both be equal in width
      until .subscribe reaches a width
      of 25rem, at which point it no longer
      grows anymore, and .recent-episodes
      continues to grow to take up the 
      rest of the available space
